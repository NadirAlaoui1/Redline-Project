# Redline website
We were given 2 websites that were badly designed and had to choose which one we wanted to
redesign. I chose a flower store and used a premade template from [Html5Up](https://html5up.net), 
which I edited to match the information and pictures that the [website](http://www.fiori.be)
provided. I used some of the website's images but added some myself too. The template was a
little bit too long for the information I gathered so I removed some of the excessive space and
sections. The webpage I made also is responsive and contains all the information a customer would
need to find the store or order via mail or phone.

## Template
The template itself was made with HTML and it uses CSS, JavaScript and fonts. The makers of the template
also used SASS for their CSS file, which really is very convenient to save time. I also did the
LightHouse test which it scored good on except for the accesibility.
